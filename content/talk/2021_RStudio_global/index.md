abstract: People who have experience in data analysis and statistical practice have established mental models of their workflow. In this way, their introduction to R is different than someone who is simultaneously learning both the underlying methods and the tool of choice (think of your typical undergraduate statistics class). Expereienced data analysts arrive in class knowing what their outcome (the artifact of their workflow) will be—perhaps a short analytic report that combines text, summary tables, and plots—and are seeking a different way to produce that artifact. In this talk I will explore how I have used RStudio, RStudio Cloud, and the tidyverse in the context of introducing experienced data analysts to the wonders of R.
