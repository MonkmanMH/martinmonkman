abstract: BC Stats has been using R as a tool to undertake analysis of socio-demographic, economic, and survey data since 2016. In the two years since then, we have made significant progress in adopting R, streamlining our workflow and moving towards more reproducible and repeatable work. This talk gives some highlights of that work, and acknowledges some of the key enablers that allowed BC Stats staff to begin using R and other elements in the R ecosystem.
