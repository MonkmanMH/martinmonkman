## It's not as glamorous as it sounds

I have spent the largest proportion of my career as a public servant at BC Stats, the provincial statistics agency in British Columbia, Canada. I now have the title of "Provincial Statistician & Director", which is not as glamorous as it sounds. But I don't have a degree in Statistics...my academic background is in Geography. How did I get here?
