>_This example was developed after one of the participants in a course I teach^[("Data Analytics Coding Fundamentals", BIDA 302)[https://continuingstudies.uvic.ca/business-technology-and-public-relations/courses/data-analytics-coding-fundamentals], part of the University of Victoria Continuing Studies' Business Intelligence and Data Analytics series] asked for a real-life example of when we might employ a filtering join.

> The example will be revised and added as a vignette in the ({Lahman} package)[https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Lahman].

## Introduction

Joins are a powerful tool in data science, allowing us to combine the contents of two tables on one or more shared variables. (Efficiency in storage, etc)

Mutating joins (those that add variables) such as left and full joins are the most commonly used, and the ones that are most straightfoward to explain. _Filtering joins_ are a different story; the explanation is somewhat more abstract, perhaps because they are less frequently used in the wild.

Here we will use the Lahman database of baseball data to explore both mutating and filtering joins. The table `Batting` contains the annual records of individual players who came up to bat by each team they played for, going back to `r min(Lahman::Batting$yearID)`. Thus a player who played multiple seasons or for multiple teams in a single season will have multiple records (rows) in the table. In the `Batting` table, each player is identified with a single unique code in the variable `playerID`, with the first four characters from their first name, the first two from their second name, and a two digit specifier to accommodate cases where there are multiple players with the same (or similar) names.

The `People` table contains single record for each player, including their full name, date of birth, and other biographical details. The variable `playerID` is the key variable in this table, allowing a straight-forward way to join relevant information to each of the rows in the `Batting` table. 

The `People` table contains more individuals than are present in the `Batting` table. Someone whose entire career was as a pitcher or manager would not have a record in the `Batting` table.


## A mutating join

The {Lahman} database gives us the opportunity to see the benefits of a mutating join. Here, we will filter the `Batting` table to return the list of players who hit the most home runs during the pandemic-abbreviated 2020 season.

```{r}

Batting %>% 
  filter(yearID == 2020) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = HR, n = 5) %>% 
  select(playerID, HR, yearID, teamID, lgID)


```

The first thing we might notice is that although we specified 5 records to be returned, there are 6 in the resulting table. The `slice_max()` function will return multiples in the cases when there are ties; here, there are 3 players who hit 17 home runs in 2020. (The paired function `slice_min()` has the same behaviour.)

The next thing you might observe are the player identifiers. Unless you're a baseball fan who knows the current players, these are likely to be cryptic. This is where we can use a join function to get the full names from the `People` table.


### Final observation

* Don’t force yourself to be something you are not

* Focus on your strengths (don't paper over your weaknesses)

* Be authentically who you really are
