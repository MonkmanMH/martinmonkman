## Pep Talk!

"Smart people ask stupid questions." (Source unknown)

Any language, computer or human, can be a challenge to learn. We bring our established ways of thinking, and another language won't always conform to those ideas. For example, French has gendered nouns -- for example, _le pot_ (pot or drink) and _la peau_ (skin) -- and English does not. For an English-speaker, this can be frustrating!

One of the most important developers of R packages (and co-author of our textbook), Hadley Wickham, was recently [quoted in an interview](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):

>**It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated.** I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.
