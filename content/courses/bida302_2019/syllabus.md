## Course Objectives



## Course Philosophy

Analysis of data helps us make better decisions. And computers have accelerated how much data we can analyze.

We can do data analysis using GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools, such as Excel or Tableau. But using a programing language to write code that generates your analysis will make your analysis workflow reproducible and auditable, accurate, and collaborative.  

In this course the emphasis will be on universal analytic methods, coding concepts, and programming practice that are universal; we will be primarily using the open source programming language R, with tangents into data analysis coding in Excel and Python.

I really like this description, so (with the author's permission) I am including it here:

> Over the last decade there has been a revolution in statistical and scientific computing. Open source languages like R and Python have overtaken older (and expensive!) corporate software packages like SAS and SPSS, and there are now thousands of books and blog posts and other online resources with excellent tutorials about how to analyze pretty much any kind of data.

>This class will expose you to R—-one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough to be able to find how to analyze any sort of data-based question in the future.

## Pep Talk!

There are no stupid questions. "Smart people ask stupid questions." (Source unknown)

>Learning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new lanugage, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2—[made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):

>**It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated.** I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

>If you’re finding yourself taking way too long, hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions in Slack [in our context, Moodle], e-mail me, etc.

>I _promise_ you can do this.

## Course Materials

### The Textbook

The textbook is Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, _R for Data Science_. 

* paper copies are available at the UVic Bookstore or other retailers

* the book, in a more up-to-date and including-more-material form, is freely available online at [r4ds.had.co.nz](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)



### Articles, book chapters, and other materials

Other resources--some required, some vital reference resources, and some optional "food for thought"--will be included in the  materials for each week's class. A cumulative resource list will be made available as part of this course site.
