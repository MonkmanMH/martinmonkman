## Course Philosophy

Analysis of data helps us make better decisions. And computers have accelerated how much data we can analyze.

We can do data analysis using GUI (Graphical User Interface) tools, such as Excel or Tableau. But using a programing language to write code that generates your analysis will make your analysis workflow: 

* reproducible and auditable, 

* accurate, and 

* collaborative.  

The emphasis in this course will be on analytic methods, coding concepts, and programming practice that are universal; you will be able to apply them in whatever analytic setting you find yourself, and are independent of the tool you'll be using. 

In this course we will be primarily using the open source programming language R, with tangents into data analysis coding in Excel and Python.

Here's another course description, one that I really like, so (with the author's permission) I am including it here:

> Over the last decade there has been a revolution in statistical and scientific computing. Open source languages like R and Python have overtaken older (and expensive!) corporate software packages like SAS and SPSS, and there are now thousands of books and blog posts and other online resources with excellent tutorials about how to analyze pretty much any kind of data.

>This class will expose you to R—one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough to be able to find how to analyze any sort of data-based question in the future.

## Evaluation

### Class participation (marks: 20)

* attendance

* doing the readings

* asking questions, responding to the questions of others, and collaborating with other participants


### Weekly assignments (marks: 12 each, 48 total)

* four assignments, due Weeks 2 through 5

* these four assignments will review the concepts introduced in that week's lesson and build on previous concepts

* the assignments will be introduced and discussed at the end of the previous week's lesson; there may be time to work on the assignment in-class

* there will be no "weekly assignment" to hand in at Week 6, because you'll be presenting your Project that week


### Additional stretch assignments (marks: 0)

* these _optional_ assignments will give you the opportunity for additional practice and to flex your developing coding muscles

* they are optional


### Project (marks: 30)

* a small project that will require the application of all of the concepts introduced

  - importing data
  
  - data wrangling
  
  - data modeling and summarization
  
  - communication

## Pep Talk!

"Smart people ask stupid questions." (Source unknown)

Any language, computer or human, can be a challenge to learn. We bring our established ways of thinking, and another language won't always conform to those ideas. For example, French has gendered nouns -- _le pot_ (pot or drink) and _la peau_ (skin) -- and English does not. For an English-speaker, this can be frustrating!

One of the most important developers of R packages (and co-author of our textbook), Hadley Wickham, was recently [quoted in an interview](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):

>**It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated.** I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.
