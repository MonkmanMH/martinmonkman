Baseball has characteristics that create an illusion that it has an immutable nature, that the game played today is the same as it was a hundred (or more) years ago. And while it is true there are some elements that have not changed, such as the 90 feet between the bases and three-strikes-and-you're-out, other elements have been constantly shifting.

One such element in Major League Baseball (MLB) that has fluctuated over time is the number of runs scored per game by each team. And those changes have, for a variety of reasons, been different in the National League (NL) and the American League (AL).

[The MLB Run Scoring Trends data visualization app](https://monkmanmh.shinyapps.io/MLBrunscoring_shiny/), built in R using the [{shiny}](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package and deployed to the [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) service, gives users a chance to explore run scoring trends in the MLB since 1901, and to explore each team's performance in runs scored and allowed relative to the league average.
